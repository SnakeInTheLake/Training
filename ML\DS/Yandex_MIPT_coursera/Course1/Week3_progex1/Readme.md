# Global optimization and optimization of non-smooth fucntions.
Skills:
- Using SciPy for optimizing functions.
- Choosing appropriate method of optimization for different problems.
## Task 1. Optimization of a smooth function.
Optimize f(x) = sin(x / 5) * exp(x / 10) + 5 * exp(-x / 2) with BFGS method from SciPy.

## Task 2. Global optimization.
Optimize the same function with differential evolution method from SciPy.

## Task 3. Optimization of a non-smooth function.
Optimize h(x) = int(f(x)) with BFGS and differential evolution methods and compare their performance.
