# Banners placement.

Let's pretend that international cruise agency "Carnival Cruise Line" decided to advertise itself using banners. To test if banners can be of much help, there will be placed 20 banners all over the world. The task is to choose 20 locations where banners will be the most helpful. The agency is pretty big and has offices in different countries. So it wants to place banners in vicinity of these offices but the location must also be very popular among tourists.  
To find such places we'll use the database of the largest social network based on locations â€” Foursqare. The data can be found [here](https://archive.org/details/201309_foursquare_dataset_umn).
