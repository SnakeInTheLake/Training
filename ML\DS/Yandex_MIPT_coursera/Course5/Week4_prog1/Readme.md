# Recommender Systems.

Let's pretend that small online store asked us to add products ranking to the "Recently viewed" section. Now it must show products that client have already seen and will most likely buy. The solution quality will be estimated by the differences in number of sales compared to the last A/B test.  
The task is to build simple baselines for the problem: ranking viewed products by view frequency and by buy frequency. These baselines can give us a rough estimation of the ranking effect.
