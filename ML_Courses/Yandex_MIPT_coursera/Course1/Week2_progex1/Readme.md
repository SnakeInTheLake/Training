# Texts similarity and function approximation.
Skills:  
- Reading text from a file and splitting it in words.
- Translating texts into vector spaces and computing distances in these spaces.
- Solving of linear equation systems.
- Approximating any function by polynomials.

## Task 1. Sentences comparison.
There is the set of sentences from Wikipedia. Every sentence is on a "cat theme" which has one of three meanings:
- Cats (animal).
- UNIX command `cat`.
- Version of OS X that named after feline family.  

The task is to find 2 sentences which are the closest by their meanings to the first line sentence.

## Task 2. Function approximation.
Find approximation to the function f(x) = sin(x / 5) * exp(x / 10) + 5 * exp(-x / 2) by solving the linear equation system.
