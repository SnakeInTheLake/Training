# Data visualization.

The task is to learn how to visualize data. Visualizing can help to understand how to preprocess data and which features to add or drop.  
We will visualize data from one of the Kaggle [competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/prudential-life-insurance-assessment).

Objectives:
- Explore data
- Try different methods of visualization
- Analyze graphs and make inferences that will help to solve the problem.
