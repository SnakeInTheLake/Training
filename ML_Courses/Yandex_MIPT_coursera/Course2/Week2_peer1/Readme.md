# Linear regression: Overfitting and Regularization.

In this task we'll see how linear models overfit and get a grip on why do they do this. Also we'll find out how to detect and control overfitting.  
The dataset `bikes_rent.csv` contains information of weather conditions on a particular day and number of bikes are rent on that day.  
The task is to predict the latter by using linear regression.
